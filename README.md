## 📌 Project Overview

Recruiters spend significant time manually screening resumes.

👉 This project solves that problem by building an **AI-powered system** that:

* Classifies resumes into job roles
* Extracts relevant technical skills
* Compares resumes with job descriptions
* Identifies missing skills (**Skill Gap Analysis**)

All presented through a **clean, interactive dashboard UI**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Upload Resume (**PDF / TXT**)
✅ Automatic Text Extraction (NLP)
✅ Job Role Prediction (ML Model)
✅ Skill Extraction Engine
✅ Resume vs Job Description Matching
✅ Match Score Calculation
✅ Skill Gap Analysis (Missing Skills)
✅ Interactive Dashboard UI (Streamlit)

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

```
Resume → Text Extraction → NLP Processing → TF-IDF → ML Model → Predictions
                                               ↓
                                   Skill Extraction Engine
                                               ↓
                              JD Matching + Skill Gap Analysis
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Upload resume
2. Extract text from PDF/TXT
3. Clean & preprocess text
4. Convert text → TF-IDF features
5. Predict job role using ML model
6. Extract skills using keyword matching
7. Compare with job description
8. Generate:

   * Match Score
   * Matched Skills
   * Missing Skills

## 💻 Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chintan-02/smart-resume-classifier
cd smart-resume-classifier

python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m streamlit run app.py
```

👉 Open:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## 🔁 Retrain Model

```bash
python train.py
```

---

## 📓 Notebook (For Learning)

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

```
notebooks/Resume_Classifier_Project.ipynb
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment (Azure)

This project is deployed using **Azure App Service**.

Deployment includes:

* GitHub CI/CD integration
* Custom startup command
* Environment configuration

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Deep Learning (BERT / Transformers)
* Advanced NER for skill extraction
* Multi-language resume support
* Resume ranking system
* Recruiter dashboard with analytics

---

## 📈 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ End-to-end ML pipeline
✔ Real-world use case
✔ Deployment on cloud (Azure)
✔ Clean UI/UX
✔ Business impact focused

---

## ⭐ Final Note

This project uses a **sample dataset for demonstration**.
For production-level performance, integrate a larger dataset and advanced NLP models.
